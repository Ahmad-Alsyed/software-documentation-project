This section outlines common issues that users or developers may encounter while using or maintaining the weather website application, along with solutions to resolve these issues.

1. Issue: API Connection Failure
Symptom: The website fails to retrieve weather data and displays a "No Data Available" error.
Possible Causes:
API key is missing or invalid.
API service is down or unreachable.
Solution:
Ensure that the correct API key is provided in the configuration.
Check the status of the API service (e.g., via the API provider's status page).
Verify internet connectivity.

2. Issue: Incorrect Weather Data Displayed
Symptom: The weather data displayed does not match real-time data or shows outdated information.
Possible Causes:
Cached data being used instead of fetching new data.
Incorrect API call parameters (e.g., wrong city ID or coordinates).
Solution:
Clear the browser cache or force the website to fetch new data by refreshing the page.
Double-check the API call parameters and ensure they are accurate.

3. Issue: Website Load Time is Slow
Symptom: The website takes a long time to load, especially when fetching weather data.
Possible Causes:
Slow internet connection or server response time.
Heavy images or scripts slowing down the page.
Solution:
Optimize the website by compressing images and minifying scripts.
Consider using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to improve loading times for users in different regions.

4. Issue: City Search Function Not Working
Symptom: Users are unable to search for cities or no results are returned for valid city names.
Possible Causes:
API call not handling city names correctly.
City data not properly parsed or handled by the front end.
Solution:
Ensure that the API call includes proper encoding for city names, especially those with special characters.
Check the front-end code responsible for displaying search results and debug any errors related to parsing.

5. Issue: UI Display Issues
Symptom: Weather information is not displayed correctly or is misaligned on different devices (e.g., mobile vs. desktop).
Possible Causes:
CSS issues affecting the layout of the website.
Different screen resolutions causing layout shifts.
Solution:
Test the website on multiple devices and browsers to ensure responsive design.
Use media queries in CSS to adjust the layout for various screen sizes.
